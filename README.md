Rocco Hafenstein's GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository contains various projects and assessments I have completed during my Data Analytics journey at QUT and beyond. Below you will find a detailed overview of each project and file included in this portfolio.
Projects
1. Assessment Visualisation Project

File: Assessment Visualisation.ipynb
Description:
This notebook contains a series of data visualizations and analysis based on air traffic data spanning from 1984 to 2022. The project showcases:

    Data Manipulation: Filtering, grouping, and pivoting data for meaningful insights.
    Advanced Visualizations: Creating heatmaps, time-series plots, and network graphs using matplotlib, seaborn, and networkx.
    Geographical Data: Handling and visualizing data related to air traffic locations, patterns, and trends.

Skills Demonstrated:

    Data wrangling using Pandas
    Time-series and geographic visualizations
    Advanced customizations in Matplotlib

2. Point of Sale System Assessment

File: Point of Sale System Assessment.ipynb
Description:
This notebook focuses on analyzing sales data for multiple businesses over different years. The main objectives were:

    Profit Analysis: Calculate the profit for each business per year.
    Product Popularity: Determine the most popular products sold.
    Customer Loyalty: Identify the most loyal customers based on transaction frequency.

Skills Demonstrated:

    Working with nested JSON data structures
    Business analytics and profit calculations
    Python programming for large datasets

3. Good Nature Progress Report

File: Good Nature Progress Report.pdf
Description:
This document outlines my work on optimizing pest control strategies for Good-natured, a New Zealand-based company focused on rodent management. The report includes:

    Environmental Analysis: Investigating how temperature, time, and seasonal patterns impact trap success.
    Trap Performance: Analyzing which configurations and conditions yield the highest success rates.
    Recommendations: Offering actionable insights on improving trap deployment and effectiveness.

Key Findings:

    Optimal temperature for trap success is around 18Â°C.
    Rodent activity peaks during cooler months, especially between 8 AM and 2 PM.

Skills Demonstrated:

    Data cleaning and analysis
    Environmental data interpretation
    Reporting and recommendation formulation based on analytical findings

    Notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) containing Python code, data visualizations, and analysis.
    Reports: PDF files providing detailed reports on completed projects.
    Data: Cleaned datasets used within the notebooks for analysis (if included).

Technologies Used

    Python: Core programming language for data analysis.
    Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
    Matplotlib/Seaborn/NetworkX: Data visualization libraries.
